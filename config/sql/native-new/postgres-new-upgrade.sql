-- @formatter:off because of terribly unreliable IDEA reformat for SQL
-- This is the update script for the MAIN REPOSITORY, it will not work for a separate audit database.
-- It is safe to run this script repeatedly, so if you're not sure you're up to date.

-- SCHEMA-COMMIT is a commit which should be used to initialize the DB for testing changes below it.
-- Check out that commit and initialize a fresh DB with postgres-new-audit.sql to test upgrades.

-- Initializing the last change number used in postgres-new-upgrade.sql.
call apply_change(0, $$ SELECT 1 $$, true);

-- SCHEMA-COMMIT 4.0: commit 69e8c29b

-- changes for 4.4.1

-- adding trigger to mark org closure for refresh when org is inserted/deleted
call apply_change(1, $aa$
-- The trigger that flags the view for refresh after m_org changes.
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION mark_org_closure_for_refresh_org()
    RETURNS trigger
    LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO m_global_metadata VALUES ('orgClosureRefreshNeeded', 'true')
    ON CONFLICT (name) DO UPDATE SET value = 'true';

    -- after trigger returns null
    RETURN NULL;
END $$;

-- Update is not necessary, it does not change relations between orgs.
-- If it does, it is handled by trigger on m_ref_object_parent_org.

-- WRITE CHANGES ABOVE ^^
-- IMPORTANT: update apply_change number at the end of postgres-new.sql
-- to match the number used in the last change here!
